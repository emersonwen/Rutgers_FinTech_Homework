## Results

One of ComplyAdvantage's biggest achievement is their ability to analyze five million new articles across 200 countries and update 30,000 KYC (Know Your Customer) profiles within 24 hours. (*[Source](https://builtin.com/fintech/regtech-companies)*) They have also been able to consistently identify high-risk customers with fewer false-positives and remediate alerts with speed and ease. 

The key core metrics that this company use to measure success are the number of individuals they are able to profile, the number of companies that they have data connections with, the number of facts they have indexed, the number of connections in their data points, and the number of sources for their data and information. According to their website, they have profiled 2 billion individuals, connected to 700 million companies, indexed 100 billion facts, have 500 million connections in their data points, and have access to 20,000 sources. 

ComplyAdvantage is a relatively young startup with approximately 300 employees globally in comparison to their competitors. However, many of their competitors are also primarily young and small scale.

## Recommendations


One potential product for this company is to service regular retail customers via the financial companies they partner with. The goal is to alert retail customers of any potential scams or illegal activities that they may unknowingly participate in. They can leverage the power of retail customers with the sheer number and their willingness to combat money laundering crime not only on a global scale, but they can also encompass the bad actors with even more prevasive monitoring.

The current technologies ComplyAdvantage utilizes is fairly sufficient at accomplishing this. They may have to collaborate with their corporate accounts to build or implement a user-interface that will service the retail customers directly. Additional technologies may be mobile applications and AI assistants to make product delivery to and interactions with retail customers more seamless.
